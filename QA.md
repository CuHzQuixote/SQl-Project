What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

my risk areas are the productRefundAmount, sessionQualityDim, and Time columns in the all_sessions table

because they either had no data or relation to other tables or the numbers just weren't able to be made
into something that would make sense. 

other risk areas are that are multiple columns that could all be combined into one table.
for example all of the "fullvisitorid", "productSKu", "productname", and "channelgrouping" columns
