What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

my risk areas are the productRefundAmount, sessionQualityDim, and Time columns in the all_sessions table

because they either had no data or relation to other tables or the numbers just weren't able to be made
into something that would make sense. 

other risk areas are that are multiple columns that could all be combined into one table.
for example all of the "fullvisitorid", "productSKu", "productname", and "channelgrouping" columns





QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.

for my QA process I cleaned up most of the number amounts in excel by dividing costs/prices by 1,000,000 like the instructions
said. when I was Inputting the tables into sql from excel I made sure to follow the instructions clearly and made sure
I had the same names for the columns so then it would import correctly.
