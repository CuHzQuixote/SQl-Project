# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(My goal with this project is to apply everthing I have learned so far in the course
to a real life situation by cleaning a very disorganized database. hopefully by the end I'll have
a better understanding and more confidence in my skills)

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions

it told us when,where and how people were buying things from a website. How long they were on the site 
and how many times they visited. the tables also told us categories of products and their names. when all connected
the tables can easily answer questions and give insights about the database when given the time to asnwer and create them.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project
the challenges were not really knowing where to start, or knowing if I was going in the right direction.
another challange was not really having an example of what a finished product looked like.
It was definitly a good test of our skills and patience.)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?
If I had more time I would spend more time looking over the data and try to understand it more
and not just focus on trying to clean it and make it look good)
